Efficient data batching
=======================

By default PopTorch will process the ``batch_size`` which you provided to
the :py:class:`poptorch.DataLoader`.

When using the other options below, the actual number of samples used per step
varies to allow the IPU(s) to process data more efficiently.

However, the effective (mini-)batch size for operations which depend on it (such
as batch normalization) will not change. All that changes is how much data is
actually sent for a single step.

.. note:: Failure to use :py:class:`poptorch.DataLoader` may result in
   accidentally changing the effective batch size for operations which depend on
   it, such as batch normalization.

poptorch.DataLoader
===================

Poptorch provides a thin wrapper around the traditional `torch.utils.data.DataLoader <https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.1/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader>`_
to abstract away some of the batch sizes calculations. If :py:class:`poptorch.DataLoader`
is used in a distributed execution environment, it will ensure that each process uses
a different subset of the dataset.

If you set the ``DataLoader`` ``batch_size`` to more than 1 then each operation
in the model will process that number of elements at any given time.

See below for usage example.

poptorch.AsynchronousDataAccessor
=================================

To reduce host overhead you can offload the data loading process to a
separate thread by specifying :py:class:`mode=poptorch.DataLoaderMode.Async <poptorch.DataLoaderMode>` in the
:py:class:`~poptorch.DataLoader` constructor. Internally this uses an
:py:class:`~poptorch.AsynchronousDataAccessor`. Doing this allows you to reduce
the host/IPU communication overhead by using the time that the IPU is running
to load the next batch on the CPU. This means that when the IPU is finished
executing and returns to host the data will be ready for the IPU to pull in again.

.. warning:: :py:class:`~poptorch.AsynchronousDataAccessor` makes use of the Python
  ``multiprocessing`` module's `spawn` start method. Consequently, the entry point of
  a program that uses it must be guarded by a ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` block
  to avoid endless recursion. The dataset used must also be picklable. For more
  information, please see https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods.

.. warning:: Tensors being iterated over using an
  :py:class:`~poptorch.AsynchronousDataAccessor` use shared memory. You must clone
  tensors at each iteration if you wish to keep their references outside of each
  iteration.

  Consider the following example:

  .. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    predictions, labels = [], []

    for data, label in dataloader:
        predictions += poptorch_model(data)
        labels += label

  The ``predictions`` list will be correct because it's producing a new tensor from the
  inputs. However, The list ``labels`` will contain identical references. This line
  would need to be replaced with the following:

  .. code-block:: python

    labels += label.detach().clone()

Rebatching iterable datasets
----------------------------

There are `two types of datasets in PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.1/data.html#dataset-types>`_ : map-style datasets and iterable datasets.

As explained in the notes of PyTorch's `Data Loading Order and Sampler <https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.1/data.html#data-loading-order-and-sampler>`_ : for
`IterableDataset <https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.1/data.html#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset>`_ :
"When fetching from iterable-style datasets with multi-processing, the drop_last argument drops the
last non-full batch of each workerâ€™s dataset replica."

This means that if the number of elements is naively
divided among the number of workers (which is the default behaviour) then potentially a significant number of elements will be dropped.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

  num_tensors = 100
  num_workers = 7
  batch_size = 4

  per_worker_tensors = ceil(100 / num_workers) = 15
  last_worker_tensors = 100 - (num_workers - 1) * per_worker_tensors = 10

  num_tensors_used = batch_size * (floor(per_worker_tensors / batch_size) * (num_workers - 1) + floor(last_worker_tensors / batch_size))
                   = 80

This means in this particular case 20% of the dataset will never be used. But, in general the larger the number of workers and the batch size, the more data will end up being unused.

To work around this issue PopTorch has a :py:class:`mode=poptorch.DataLoaderMode.AsyncRebatched <poptorch.DataLoaderMode>`.
PopTorch will set the ``batch_size`` in the PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader to ``1`` and will instead create the batched tensors in its worker process.

The shape of the tensors returned by the DataLoader will be the same as before, but the number of used tensors from the dataset  will increase to
``floor(num_tensors / batch_size) * batch_size`` (which means all the tensors would be used in the example above).

.. note:: This flag is not enabled by default because the behaviour is different from the upstream DataLoader.

poptorch.Options.deviceIterations
=================================

If you set :py:meth:`~poptorch.Options.deviceIterations` to more
than 1 then you are telling PopART to execute that many batches in sequence.

Essentially, it is the equivalent of launching the IPU in a loop over that
number of batches. This is efficient because that loop runs on the IPU
directly.

poptorch.Options.replicationFactor
==================================

:py:meth:`~poptorch.Options.replicationFactor` will replicate the model over
multiple IPUs to allow automatic data parallelism across many IPUs.

.. _gradient_accumulation:

poptorch.Options.Training.gradientAccumulation
==============================================

You need to use
:py:meth:`~poptorch.options._TrainingOptions.gradientAccumulation`
when training with pipelined models because the weights are shared across
pipeline batches so gradients will be both updated and used by subsequent
batches out of order.
Note :py:meth:`~poptorch.options._TrainingOptions.gradientAccumulation`
is only needed by :py:class:`poptorch.PipelinedExecution`.

See also :py:class:`poptorch.Block`.

In the code example below, :py:class:`poptorch.Block` introduced in
:numref:`parallel_execution` is used to divide up
a different model into disjoint subsets of layers.
These blocks can be shared among multiple parallel execution strategies.

.. literalinclude:: mnist.py
  :language: python
  :linenos:
  :start-after: annotations_start
  :end-before: annotations_end
  :emphasize-lines: 12, 14, 16, 18, 34
  :caption: A training model making use of :py:class:`poptorch.Block`

You can see the code examples of :py:class:`poptorch.SerialPhasedExecution`,
:py:class:`poptorch.PipelinedExecution`, and
:py:class:`poptorch.ShardedExecution` below.

An instance of class :py:class:`poptorch.PipelinedExecution` defines an
execution strategy that assigns layers to multiple IPUs as a pipeline. Gradient
accumulation is used to push multiple batches through the pipeline allowing
IPUs to run in parallel.

:numref:`figPipeline` shows the pipeline execution for multiple batches
on IPUs. There are 4 pipeline stages running on 4 IPUs respectively.
Gradient accumulation enables us to keep the same number of pipeline stages,
but with a wider pipeline.
This helps hide the latency, which is the total time for one item to go
through the whole system, as highlighted.

.. _anchorReturnType:

poptorch.Options.Training.anchorReturnType
==========================================

When you use a :py:func:`~poptorch.inferenceModel`, you will usually want to
receive all the output tensors. For this reason, PopTorch will return them
all to you by default. However, you can change this behaviour using
:py:func:`poptorch.Options.anchorMode`.

When you use a :py:func:`~poptorch.trainingModel`, you will often not need to
receive all or any of the output tensors and it is more efficient not to
receive them. For this reason, PopTorch only returns the last batch of tensors
by default. As in the the case of ``inferenceModel``, you can change this
behaviour using :py:func:`poptorch.Options.anchorMode`.

If you want to monitor training using a metric such as loss or accuracy, you
may wish to take into account all tensors. To do this with minimal or no
overhead, you can use ``poptorch.AnchorMode.Sum``. For example:
