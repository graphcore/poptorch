.. _supported_ops:

IPU supported operations
************************

Below is a list of currently supported operations that can be
executed on IPU hardware. This list will be expanded over time
as we add more support. Some overloads and modes of operation
for ops are not supported and we've tried to list all the caveats
but some may have been missed.


Torch operations
================

Tensor operations
-----------------

Many of the tensor operations will be executed before even reaching the IPU
so we can consider them supported anyway. Some, like ``contiguous()``, make
no sense on a distributed memory system like the IPU so are ignored. There
are no constraints on the memory format of how operations should be called
other than the constraint that all graph inputs should be contiguous.

We will also create tensor views. However, the aliasing property of views
with respect to in-place operations should not be relied on as we may have slightly different view behaviour.

Additionally, some PyTorch operations may be implemented by composition of
the listed ops but may not be explicitly listed but are in fact supported.

Indexing, slicing, joining and mutating ops
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In PyTorch, slicing a tensor is accessing a subset of the tensor by providing the start and end indices, such as ``tensor[1:5]``.

With a PopTorch model, you may take a slice of a tensor only if one of two conditions are met:

* The start and end are constants, or can be resolved to be constants (for example, a function of the shape of a tensor which does not change between runs).
* The start and end of the slice are related by a constant, for example ``tensor[x:x+5]``. Please note that this will produce different results to PyTorch if the end value exceeds the length of the tensor: PyTorch will output a smaller size tensor but PopTorch will allow the slice to wrap round to the start of the relevant dimension.

* ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose1d``
* ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d``
* ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d``

Currently the max pool layers do not return the indices
so only the variants with ``return_indices=False`` are supported.

* ``torch.nn.MaxPool1d``
* ``torch.nn.MaxPool2d``
* ``torch.nn.MaxPool3d``
* ``torch.nn.AvgPool1d``

are not currently supported for any recurrent layer. In addition,
setting ``bias=False`` is currently only supported for ``torch.nn.GRU``.

Loss functions
--------------

This version supports a limited subset of loss functions. However, we support
:py:func:`~poptorch.identity_loss` which gives you the ability to implement any arbitrary
loss function.

.. seealso:: :py:func:`~poptorch.identity_loss`

One caveat for the following loss functions is if they are used they will always be included
in the back propagation and will always receive a gradient, which is a slight deviation from
normal PyTorch operations, where they have to opt in to the gradient pass.

.. _float_16_op_support:

16-bit float operations
=======================

.. warning::
   Handling of ``float16`` operations has been greatly simplified since PopTorch version 3.0. Please read this section
   carefully if you are used to the way this worked prior to version 3.0.

In PopTorch version 3.0 and later, ``float16`` operations are handled straightforwardly by the dispatcher frontend.
Tensors and models can be freely cast to and from ``float16``, and normalization running
statistics can also be retyped by simple casting.

If you have PopTorch code created with a previous version of PopTorch, see :numref:`float_16_migration`.

.. _float_16_migration:

16-bit float migration
======================

Legacy PopTorch code using ``float16`` can be updated for the dispatcher frontend by considering the following points:

* Casts were not well supported by the tracing frontend. They are fully supported by the dispatcher frontend.

* ``opts.Precision.halfFloatCasting()`` was used to switch between ways of resolving ops with
  both ``float32`` and ``float16`` inputs (mixed-precision inputs), either by upcasting the inputs to ``float32``, or by
  downcasting them to ``float16``. This option is not supported under the dispatcher frontend: mixed precision ops are
  now always upcast to ``float32``, in accordance with normal PyTorch behaviour. To recreate the effect of
  ``opts.Precision.halfFloatCasting(poptorch.HalfFloatCastingBehavior.FloatDowncastToHalf)``,
  which was the default behaviour with the tracing frontend, ``float32`` inputs to mixed-precision ops should be
  explicitly cast to ``float16`` before being passed to the op.

* ``opts.Precision.runningStatisticsAlwaysFloat()`` was used to cause the running mean and variance of certain
  normalization ops to be calculated in ``float32`` precision, even though the normalization module itself had been cast
  to ``float16``. This option is not supported in the dispatcher frontend, as the same effect can be achieved by simply
  casting the running statistic tensors back to ``float32`` before running the model.

Gradient computation control
============================

``torch.no_grad`` is supported as a context manager as well as a decorator to suppress the
computation of gradients locally.
