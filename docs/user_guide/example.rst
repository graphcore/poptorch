MNIST example
_____________

The example in :numref:`mnist-example-code` shows how a MNIST model can be run on the IPU. The highlighted lines show the PopTorch-specific code required to run the example on multiple IPUs.

You can download the full source code from GitHub: `mnist.py <https://github.com/graphcore/poptorch/blob/sdk-release-2.4/examples/mnist.py>`__.

To run this example you will need to install the Poplar SDK (see the `Getting Started Guide <https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html>`__ for your IPU system) and the appropriate version of ``torchvision``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install torchvision==0.11.1

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mnist.py
